### Project Architecture

The project is built on a pure PyOpenGL architecture for maximum performance and control. Key features include:

* **Dynamic 3D Grid:** A 3D cellular automaton with a vectorized NumPy backend.
* **Touch Capabilities:** The visualizer is optimized for touch input, translating screen taps into interactive events.
* **OS Module Tiles & Templates:** A modular system for loading assets directly from your file system.
* **Adaptive Transparency:** A custom shader will be built to create dynamic transparency based on a node's state.

We appreciate the conceptual guidance from `OpenGLContext` and `PyOpenGL-accelerate` and have built our project to be compatible with a similar architectural philosophy.
